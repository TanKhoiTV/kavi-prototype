# Beam-sweep host aggregate — Opus-MT vi→en

**Date:** 2026-09-28
**Dataset:** 30 MT items with `reference_text`, from `eval_manifest_v1.json`
**Candidate:** `opus-mt-vi-en-ct2-cpu` — Helsinki-NLP Opus-MT vi→en via CTranslate2 int8, CPU
**Status:** supporting evidence for open parameter #6 in
[`docs/decisions/README.md`](../decisions/README.md). **Not a decision.** See
[ADR-020](../decisions/ADR-020-pipeline-concurrency.md) for the deferral.

This file exists because the numbers quoted in ADR-020 need a source a reader can
check. The raw per-item output is not one: it lives under `bench-results/`, which
is gitignored (`.gitignore:44`) and therefore tracked on no branch. This is the
reduced table that *is* tracked, plus the method that produces it.

## Reproducing

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.summarise_beam_sweep \
  bench-results/archive/beam-sweep/fleurs/opus-mt-vi-en-ct2-cpu
```

## Aggregate

| beam | n | sentence-BLEU | corpus BLEU | mean s | mean ratio | median s | median ratio | p95 s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (greedy) | 30 | 6.22 | 3.98 | 0.558 | 1.00× | 0.475 | 1.00× | 1.248 |
| 2 | 30 | 7.81 | 5.39 | 0.911 | 1.63× | 0.813 | 1.71× | 1.878 |
| 4 | 30 | 8.80 | 6.58 | 1.396 | 2.50× | 0.616 | 1.30× | 3.238 |
| 5 | 30 | 9.01 | 6.08 | 1.686 | 3.02× | 0.861 | 1.81× | 3.482 |
| 8 | 30 | 8.97 | 6.42 | 2.489 | 4.46× | 1.536 | 3.23× | 6.560 |

**The two BLEU columns disagree, and not only in magnitude.** The sweep's own
figure is a *mean of per-sentence* BLEU; `corpus BLEU` is SacreBLEU over the whole
item set. Averaging per-sentence scores weights a 3-word item the same as a
40-word one. The practical consequence is that the ranking moves in the middle of
the ladder:

- by sentence-BLEU the best is **beam=5** (9.01)
- by corpus BLEU the best is **beam=4** (6.58), with beam=5 *dropping* to 6.08
  and beam=8 climbing back to 6.42 — non-monotonic where sentence-BLEU was flat

The published "beam=4 sweet spot" survives under corpus BLEU, but it is not the
conclusion the sweep's own column supports. The margin is 0.16 over beam=8 and
0.50 over beam=5, on 30 items — small enough that beams 4, 5 and 8 are not
separable on quality. Anything quoted from this sweep should name its BLEU
definition.

## Why the latency column is not citable

Two independent defects, both visible in the aggregate above.

**1. Mean and median disagree, and the mean carries a long tail.** beam=4 has a
median of 0.616 s but a p95 of 3.226 s and a max of 3.810 s. Its mean-based ratio
(2.50×) is the figure the sweep published; its median-based ratio is 1.30×. The
spread is wide enough at every beam that the ordering of the ratios depends on
which statistic you pick — beam=2 is *slower* than beam=4 at the median, faster
at the mean.

**2. Per-item latency is not monotonic in beam width.** Beam search increases
decoder work monotonically *at a fixed output length*, so
`b1 ≤ b2 ≤ b4 ≤ b5 ≤ b8` is the expected ordering. It is not guaranteed per item,
though: beams can emit outputs of different lengths, and decoder steps scale with
output length. It does not hold:

- **18 of 30 items (60%)** break the ordering
- across the four adjacent transitions, **24 pairs** have the wider beam finishing
  *faster* than the narrower one

Examples, all five beams, seconds:

| item | b1 | b2 | b4 | b5 | b8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `vi-en-mt-1730` | 1.085 | 1.238 | **0.355** | 3.289 | 4.733 |
| `vi-en-mt-1675` | 0.840 | 1.339 | **0.472** | 0.607 | 1.511 |
| `vi-en-mt-1951` | 0.874 | 1.063 | **0.549** | 0.693 | 1.825 |

In all three, beam=4 is faster than **beam=1**. What happens next is not uniform:
`vi-en-mt-1730` jumps roughly 9× at beam=5, while the other two rise by only about
1.3×.

**Root cause: one timing sample per item.** The records hold exactly one
`latency_s` per item (30 items → 30 samples). `Candidate.run()` wraps a single
`_infer()` call in `time.perf_counter()` — no repeats, no warmup discard. beam=1
min is 0.049 s against a 0.475 s median. That spread is consistent with the mix
of item lengths in this set (3-word alongside 40-word items); it does not by itself
show that framework warmup is inside the sample, which would need the first item's
reading shown as anomalous. This is a separate defect from the memory-profiling
issue raised in the sweep's own retrospective, and it is not fixed by a clean clock
reading of a single noisy run.

## What this does and does not support

**Supports:** the *quality* side of the beam trade-off. BLEU rises materially from
greedy to beam=4 under either definition (+2.58 sentence-BLEU, +2.60 corpus BLEU),
and flattens or regresses beyond that. This is the one measurement in the sweep
that survives scrutiny.

**Does not support:** any claim about whether beam=4 fits the latency budget. These
are host-relative ratios from a laptop CPU. The 2.0 s turnaround gate in ADR-020 is
an on-device number, and the on-device MT runner is still a stub. The gap between
2.50× and 1.30× above is enough to flip the answer either way, which is precisely
why the host column cannot stand in for the device measurement.
