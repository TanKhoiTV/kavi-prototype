# Architecture Decision Records

One decision per record. This index is the entry point: it lists every ADR with
its current status, shows the supersession graph, and records the open parameters
that no ADR has closed yet.

Records live alongside this file as `ADR-NNN-<slug>.md`. Decisions are never
deleted and numbers are never reused — a decision that is replaced points at its
successor, and a record that was split points at the records it became.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Proposed** | Written and under consideration; not yet binding |
| **Accepted** | Binding. May carry an inline revision note if later amended |
| **Superseded by ADR-NNN** | Replaced. Retained as the historical record |
| **Withdrawn** | Not a decision after all; retained for provenance |

An ADR may be *Accepted* and still have an **open parameter** — a sub-choice
(model binary, threshold value) that was deliberately left to measurement. Those
are listed in [Open parameters](#open-parameters) rather than being invented as
decisions.

**Not an ADR:** [`docs/reference/rtranslator-comparison.md`](../reference/rtranslator-comparison.md)
— an architectural comparison with RTranslator 2.1.5. It contains analysis and
adopted patterns, not a decision, and previously collided with the ADR-007 number.

## Split provenance (2026-09-25)

Several records held multiple decisions, which made their file-level status
misleading — most notably ADR-007, which was labelled *"Superseded by ADR-008"*
even though ADR-008 supersedes only one of its eleven decisions. Each was split
into one decision per record; the originals were renamed (retaining their number)
and carry a split note.

| Original | Became |
| --- | --- |
| ADR-005 `Decision 1–5` | [ADR-005](ADR-005-qnn-isnan-workaround.md) + [ADR-023](ADR-023-decoder-on-cpu.md) + [ADR-024](ADR-024-piper-tts-on-cpu.md) (the epsilon guard became a consequence; the padding decision deduplicated into ADR-025) |
| ADR-006 `Decision 1–4` | [ADR-006](ADR-006-native-on-device-runner.md) + [ADR-025](ADR-025-app-layer-dynamic-padding.md) + [ADR-026](ADR-026-real-data-calibration.md) (the epsilon guard deduplicated into ADR-024) |
| ADR-007 `Decision 1–11` | [ADR-007](ADR-007-translation-service.md) + [ADR-013](ADR-013-persistent-model-residency.md) … [ADR-022](ADR-022-energy-vad.md) |
| ADR-008 (+ amendments) | [ADR-008](ADR-008-dual-zipformer-asr.md) + [ADR-027](ADR-027-asr-cpu-only.md); the ADR-007 amendments became revision notes in ADR-014/ADR-016 |
| ADR-009 Phase 1/2 | [ADR-009](ADR-009-supertonic-tts-v1.md) + [ADR-028](ADR-028-vieneu-tts-migration.md) |
| `license-situation.md` | [ADR-029](ADR-029-license-gate.md) + [ADR-030](ADR-030-qairt-runtime-redistribution.md) + [ADR-031](ADR-031-piper-engine-gpl-split.md) |
| `ADR-007-vs-RTranslator-comparison.md` | moved to [`docs/reference/rtranslator-comparison.md`](../reference/rtranslator-comparison.md) |

## Open parameters

Decisions deliberately left unclosed. Each is owned by an ADR; they are collected
here so nothing is silently forgotten. This register replaces the former
`ADR-004`, which was a parameter table rather than a decision.

| # | Open parameter | Owned by | Closes when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Final MT model** | *no record yet* | An MT decision ADR is written (tracked as issue #110). Opus-MT is in use and pinned in `.kavi.yaml`, but the choice was never recorded — ADR-004 deferred it and ADR-008/ADR-009 closed only ASR and TTS. *Not measurement-gated: it needs a record, not a number.* |
| 2 | **On-device denoiser model** (GTCRN vs Wiener) | [ADR-018](ADR-018-denoising-slot.md) | **Needs a number:** on-device WER for GTCRN vs Wiener on the same clips. The host-side Wiener gate is already recorded in [`docs/reference/denoising-gate-results.md`](../reference/denoising-gate-results.md). *(issue #111)* |
| 3 | **Piper engine licence path** | [ADR-031](ADR-031-piper-engine-gpl-split.md) | **Downstream of the TTS decision — not currently blocking.** Piper is fallback-only in the working position, so this closes when the TTS choice is ratified: dropped from the shipped stack → closes outright; kept as fallback → the MIT-era `rhasspy/piper` snapshot must be pinned and subprocess isolation adopted. Urgent only if Supertonic misses the RTF ≤ 0.5 gate in `.kavi.yaml`. *(issue #112)* |
| 4 | **VAD thresholds** | [ADR-022](ADR-022-energy-vad.md) | **Needs a number:** noise-condition benchmarking to fix the energy threshold and speech timeout (may trigger a model-based VAD). *(issue #113)* |
| 5 | **ASR thread-tuning build** (B vs F) | [ADR-012](ADR-012-asr-thread-tuning.md) | **Needs a number:** on-device A/B on the Meizu 21 Note, 100 utterances per mode, logging RTF, thermal status and audio-overrun counters. Build B is already the working config, so this validates it and decides whether the Build F escalation is needed; the ADR's nine platform questions also need confirming on-device. *(issue #114)* |
| 6 | **MT beam width** (greedy vs beam=4) | [ADR-020](ADR-020-pipeline-concurrency.md) | **Needs a number:** Phase-5 latency-vs-BLEU measurement. *(issue #115)* |
| 7 | **w8a16 vs w8a8** for Opus-MT | [ADR-003](ADR-003-hexagon-runtime.md) | **Needs a number:** accuracy regression measurement. *(issue #116)* |

> **Resolved — removed from the table.** **#8 QAIRT Community Edition access:**
> obtained. The SDK (`2.31.0.250130`) is installed and in use — see
> [`docs/ndk-conversion-runbook.md`](../ndk-conversion-runbook.md) §2.2 and
> `scripts/qairt-env.sh` — and
> [ADR-030](ADR-030-qairt-runtime-redistribution.md) records its licence terms.

## Conventions

- **One decision per record.** If a record needs a second `## Decision` heading,
  it needs a second record.
- **Status lives in front-matter** as `## Status` / `## Date` / `## Deciders`,
  followed by `## Context`, `## Decision`, `## Alternatives considered`,
  `## Consequences`, `## References`.
- **Never delete, never renumber.** Supersede, and leave a note.
- **Amendments are revision notes**, placed inside the record being amended, not
  new ADRs.
